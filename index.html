<h2 id="experience">üìñ Experience</h2>
<p><strong>Senior Backend Engineer, Bluescape</strong> (Sept 2018 -
Present)</p>
<h3 id="key-responsibilities">Key Responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Design, development, delivery, and maintenance of GraphQL and REST
API for 2 generations of API</li>
<li>Mentoring: Mentored 3 junior engineers through frequent meetings and
providing feedback during code reviews</li>
<li>Documentation: Contributed over 40 design, knowledge transfer and
best practices documents. Presented multiple designs to our Architecture
Council. Reviewed and gave feedback on designs</li>
<li>Code reviews: provided feedback, suggestions &amp; mentoring through
Github‚Äôs pull request system</li>
<li>Bug triage, estimation, fixing &amp; regression mitigation</li>
<li>Infrastructure champion: understand and contribute to the
jsonnet/K8S manifests, Argocd &amp; CI Github workflows that our team
relies on for infrastructure</li>
<li>API review council: presenting and participating in reviews</li>
<li>Interviewing: 10+ interviews, ranging from junior developer to
senior management; both behavioural &amp; technical</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="engineering-highlights">Engineering Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Key driver instrumental in choosing and evangelising the technology
stack for our V3 API rewrite, providing the initial architectural design
and driving the early direction of the project. Held regular design
meetings with the team around a prioritised roadmap I created that
everyone was invited to contribute to.</li>
<li>For a ‚Äúuser groups‚Äù feature which allowed users to be both directly
and indirectly (through group membership) associated with a resource;
designed &amp; implemented support for paginating heterogeneous
collections. The approach utilised ‚Äúmaterialised‚Äù views to combine
multiple tables into a single ‚Äúview‚Äù table &amp; database triggers to
automatically update the ‚Äúview‚Äù on mutation to any of the source tables.
Due to the ‚Äúview‚Äù containing a mixed collection items (users and groups)
many complications to the pagination had to be overcome such as avoiding
duplicate user entries. The use of triggers also took some engineering
effort to perfect.</li>
<li>Researched, designed and implemented a ‚Äúseek‚Äù (as opposed to offset)
based cursor pagination implementation overcoming complex issues with
ordering and null values inherent with this approach</li>
<li>Optimised permission lookup during authorization by caching the
result of flattening a DAG of groups and permissions into a single model
field that is automatically updated via hooks when related models are
mutated</li>
<li>At customer request, co-designed and implemented a 2nd tier to our
authorization using the XACML JSON profile which directly contributed to
the client continuing their contract with us. Participated in client
meetings &amp; debugging sessions. The project was challenging due to
the client being a government agency requiring secrecy and black box
nature of interacting with the client. Developed a mock PDP server for
testing the authorization flow.</li>
<li>For a security feature to migrate from integer Ids to string Uids in
our API, proposed a novel approach that minimised the amount of internal
code and DB query changes required - all internal code relied heavily on
integer primary/foreign key usage - saving a lot of development
work.</li>
<li>Introduced end to end tests (using fixtures) to catch regressions
for bug tickets I worked on leading to better code coverage and
testing</li>
<li>Early design work on implementing a OAuth2 authenticated JS client
library for wrapping ISAM REST API</li>
<li>Wrote the V3 version of our system for migrating the database</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="process-improvement-contributions">Process Improvement
Contributions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduced docker-compose as an alternative to Minishift
(kubernetes) which simplified and sped up the development feedback loop,
enabled debugging locally and reduced CPU usage. This was eventually
embraced by the whole of development.</li>
<li>Brought async/await style programming to Node 6 using generators
which allowed the team to remove complex promise chains and simplify the
code without having to add a Babel compilation phase to add shims.</li>
<li>Created shell functions wrapping docker-compose commands &amp;
others, to simplify local development for the team</li>
<li>Created a rudimentary tool to list all available API in a google
sheet by reading the code base</li>
<li>Created regression scenarios to test/verify API bug tickets using
Artillery.io greatly speeding up feedback cycles when compared to
manually testing with Postman.</li>
<li>Proliferated ‚Äúlabs‚Äù shared mono-repo for POC &amp; experimental
development used by many developers in the organization.</li>
